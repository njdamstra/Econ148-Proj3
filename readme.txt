Vouchers for Private Schooling in Colombia: Evidence from a Randomized Natural Experiment

Notes: The following programs and data files recreate Table 1 through 7 in the published paper. Some variables have been updated, so not all results exactly math the published values.

Programs: Click the links to download the program files:

    * table1_final.sas creates Table 1. Note that panel B for test takers is unavailable.
    * table2_final.sas creates Table 2.
    * table3_final.sas creates Table 3. The results for "ever used a scholarship" are created by the program that makes Table 7.
    * table4_final.sas creates Table 4.
    * table5_final.sas creates Table 5.
    * table6_final.sas creates Table 6. Note that in order to obtain the marginal effects for the probit, you must multiply the coefficient estimate by the phi1 estimate and switch the sign.
    * table7_final.sas creates Table 7 and the "ever used a scholarship" estimates in Table 3.

Data: Click the links to download the data:

    * aerdat4.sas7bdat is the core dataset. This file is used by the programs that creates Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.
    * tab5v1.sas7bdat is used by the programs that create Tables 2 and 5.
    * tab7.sas7bdat is used by table7_final.sas to create Table 7.
    * tab7test.sas7bdat is used by table7_final.sas to create Table 7.
